Well hello there, partner!  

My name is Conor Higgins, and I'm a first year masters student in the Ecology program at UC Davis. 

Generally speaking, my thesis work investigates community level interactions between ungulate herbivores and the associated plant community in an arctic ecosystem, and how these interactions may be impacted by climatic drivers.  My field work is conducted at our lab's long term study site near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.  I conduct near daily counts of the two large ungulate herbivores there (caribou; *Rangifer tarandus*, and muskoxen; *Ovibos moschatus*) as well as collect data on the timing of various plant phenological stages.  My current research questions revolve around the reciprocal interactions between muskoxen and the plant community.  More specifically: 

#### 1) How does the timing of species-specific plant green-up timing relate to the timing of peak muskox (*Ovibos moschatus*) presence and muskox calf production at the study site? 

and reciprocally 

#### 2) How does the timing of peak muskox presence at the site impact plant species-specific green-up timing, plant abundance, and plant community compositional dynamics?
